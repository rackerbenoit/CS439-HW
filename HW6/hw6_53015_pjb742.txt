----------1.

A page fault occurs when a program accesses a page that is mapped in the virtual address space but not loaded in physical memory.
I/O interruption occurs and causes a delay to the program.

----------2.

This design would not work well. This is ignoring the idea of memory being used as a cache. This does not use the ideas of locality at all. 

----------3.

A TLB is a small, virtually addressed cache where each line holds a block
consisting of a single PTE. A TLB usually has a high degree of associativity. 
It helps speed up address translation by eliminating the need for the MMU to refer to a PTE everytime it needs to translate the virtual address into a physical address

----------4.

1. 10  bits
2. 3   bits
3. 4   bits
4. 15  bits
5. 256 bytes

----------5.

When a process incurs a page fault, a local page replacement algorithm selects for replacement some page that belongs to that same process (or a group of processes sharing a memory partition). A global replacement algorithm is free to select any page in memory
Disadvantage of Local page replacement: Only have access to pages that are within your process. May have to swap out too often
Disadvantage of Global page replacement: Compete for resources to the point of deadlock
