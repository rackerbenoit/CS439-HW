Which is the best (fastest) network on which to implement a remote-memory read that sends a 100 byte packet from machine A to machine B and then sends a 8000 byte packet from machine B to machine A?
A network with 200 microsecond processing overhead, 10 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 20 microsecond latency
A network with 20 microsecond processing overhead, 10 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 200 microsecond latency
A network with 20 microsecond processing overhead, 1 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 2 microsecond latency
A network with 2 microsecond processing overhead, 1 Mbyte/s bandwidth, 20 microsecond latency
----------1.


a) {(2 * 200) + 10 + 20} + {(2 * 200) + 800 + 20} = 1650 microseconds
b) 1290 microseconds
c) 8182 microseconds
d) 8148 microseconds

In class, we covered the idea of remote procedure calls. We discussed difficulties encountered when one attempts to implement a remote procedure call. Name the four of the difficulties. There are additional complications when the procedure executes a system call. What are the complications and how might you fix them?
----------2.


You cannot pass pointers, it is a weakly typed language, it is not always possible to determine parameter types or sizes, and you may not use global variables.

Describe the steps necessary to prepare a server to accept connections. How does it accept a connection?
----------3.


Create a socket
Identify the socket
On the server, wait for an incoming connection
On the client, connect to the server's socket
Send and receive messages
Close the socket

OR more simply

Setup a socket
Bind to a port
Listen

In class, we have discussed many methods to get reliability from unreliable parts. Name and describe 2.
----------4.


TCP/IP -> Keep asking
Rollback logs with transactions
RAID

In two-phase commit, suppose the master fails after writing ``GLOBAL_COMMIT'' to disk and sending ``GLOBAL_COMMIT'' to all participating nodes but before any of the nodes receive this message. Suppose that the ``GLOBAL_COMMIT'' message reaches i of the n participants and that the participants implement a protocol in which they communicate with one another when they suspect the primary has died. What is the minimum number of participants that must receive the ``GLOBAL_COMMIT'' message to allow the participants to complete the transaction without waiting for the master to recover?
----------5.

In Class Question: How does a context switch happen?

All registers are saved, then memory, metadata -> All saved to a PCB on disk
TLB is flushed
Choose new scheduling algorithm to choose new process
Load metadata that was stored
